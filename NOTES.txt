Basics about this E-commerce Store deployment compatible with a Raspberry Pi:
Front-end: Create a responsive online store UI with frameworks like React or Angular.
Back-end: Use Node.js or Python with a framework like Express or Django.
Database: Store product information in a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Application Layer: Develop a RESTful API for managing products, orders, and payments.


More details about it:

Front-end Layer:

The front-end layer handles the user interface and is responsible for rendering the website's components and providing an interactive user experience.
In the Dockerfile, we use a lightweight Node.js image suitable for ARM64 architecture as the base image.
The Dockerfile sets the working directory, copies the package.json and package-lock.json files, installs dependencies, and copies the built React application.
The Dockerfile exposes port 80 to allow external access to the front-end application.
The CMD command starts the server using the "serve" package, serving the static files from the build directory.
Building the Docker image creates an isolated container that contains the front-end code and its dependencies.
Back-end Layer:

The back-end layer handles the server-side logic and provides APIs for interacting with the database and serving data to the front-end.
In the Dockerfile, we again use a lightweight Node.js image suitable for ARM64 architecture as the base image.
The Dockerfile sets the working directory, copies the package.json and package-lock.json files, installs dependencies, and copies the back-end code.
The Dockerfile exposes port 8000 to allow external access to the back-end server.
The CMD command starts the server by running the app.js file (you may need to adjust the filename depending on your actual back-end setup).
Building the Docker image creates an isolated container that contains the back-end code and its dependencies.
Database Layer:

The database layer manages the storage and retrieval of data required by the application.
In the Dockerfile, we use the official MySQL image, which already supports ARM64 architecture.
The Dockerfile sets environment variables for the root password and database name, and copies the database initialization script.
The Dockerfile exposes port 3306 for external access to the MySQL database.
Building the Docker image creates a container that runs the MySQL server with the specified configurations.
Application Layer:

The application layer contains the main application logic and API endpoints, connecting the front-end and back-end layers.
In the Dockerfile, we use a lightweight Node.js image suitable for ARM64 architecture as the base image.
The Dockerfile sets the working directory, copies the package.json and package-lock.json files, installs dependencies, and copies the application code.
The Dockerfile exposes port 8000 to allow external access to the application.
The CMD command starts the server by running the app.js file (adjust as needed).
Building the Docker image creates an isolated container that contains the application code and its dependencies.
Docker Compose:

The docker-compose.yml file defines the services for each layer and their configurations.
The services section specifies the build context for each layer (e.g., frontend, backend, database, application).
The ports section maps the container ports to the host machine ports, allowing external access to the services.
The depends_on section defines the dependencies between services, ensuring that the required services start in the correct order.
Running docker-compose up starts all the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file, creating separate containers for each service and establishing communication between them.
By utilizing Docker and Docker Compose, you can easily deploy the e-commerce application by building and running the containers. Each layer runs independently within its container, providing isolation and modularity. The containers communicate with each other over the specified network, allowing seamless interaction between the front-end, back-end, database, and application layers.
