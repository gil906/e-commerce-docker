Basics about this E-commerce Store deployment compatible witha Raspberry Pi:
Front-end: Create a responsive online store UI with frameworks like React or Angular.
Back-end: Use Node.js or Python with a framework like Express or Django.
Database: Store product information in a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Application Layer: Develop a RESTful API for managing products, orders, and payments.


More details about it:

Front-end:
Develop a responsive online store user interface using a front-end framework like React or Angular.
Design an intuitive and user-friendly layout for product listings, search functionality, and shopping cart management.
Implement features such as product filtering, sorting, and pagination to enhance the browsing experience.
Include a secure payment gateway integration to facilitate online transactions.

Back-end:
Use a server-side technology like Node.js or Python with a framework like Express or Django to handle business logic and API development.
Implement user authentication and authorization to manage user accounts and secure access to sensitive information.
Develop APIs for managing products, orders, user profiles, and payment processing.
Include features like product inventory management, order tracking, and shipping integration.

Database:
Store product information, including details like name, description, price, and availability, in a database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
Utilize the database to manage user information, such as account details, shipping addresses, and order history.
Implement database schema and relationships to support product categorization, reviews, and ratings.

Application Layer:
Develop a RESTful API to handle requests and responses between the front-end and back-end components.
Ensure proper validation and sanitization of user input to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Implement mechanisms for handling cart management, including adding items, updating quantities, and removing products.
Integrate with third-party payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal to securely process customer payments.

Additional Considerations:
Use responsive design principles to ensure the online store is accessible and user-friendly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Implement security measures like encryption, secure HTTP (HTTPS), and input validation to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
Consider implementing caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce server load.
Employ tools like Docker and Docker Compose to containerize each layer of the application, making it easier to deploy and manage on the Raspberry Pi 4.
